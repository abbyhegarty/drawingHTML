  <h1>Drawing HTML </h1>
<p>
The D3 algorithm can be used on data that is texted based or anything that can be transfered into a .txt file, a .csv file, or a .json document. In HTML and CSS, the hierarchical relationship were essential in using selectors to easily manipulate the code. For the d3 algorithm, chain syntax is useful when navigating mulitple methods. The most common commands used to create chains are as follows.
  </p>
  
<ol> 
  <li>Select: The select command works similar to a CSS selector. When you give it an element, it will return the first instance of this element in the DOM.</li>
<li>Append: The append will add the element you used as the input and put it at the end of the initially selected element from the beginning of the chain.  </li>
<li>Text: This command will takes a string and add it inside the opening and closing tags of the selected element.</li>
<li>Style: The style method permits us to add CSS properties and HTML attributes as either strings for simple changes or functions for more complicated results. </li>
  
</ol>
